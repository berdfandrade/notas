# Introduction to sockets 

This chapter is an introduction to socket programming. Readers are assumed to have basic knowledge of computer networking but no experience in netwrok programming. 

Readis is and exemple of the server/client system. Multiple clients connect to a single server, and the server receives requets from TCP connections and sends responses back. There are several Linux system calls we neet to learn before we cans start socket programming.

The `socket()` syscall returns an fd. Here is a rough explanation of "fd" if you are unfamilliar with Unix systems: An fs is an integer that refers to something in the Linux kernel, like a TCP connection, a disk file, a listening port, or some other resources, etc.

The `bind()` and `listen()` syscall: the `bind()` associates an address to a socket fd, and the `listen()` enable us to accept connections to that address. 

The `accept()` takes a listening fd, when a client makes a connection to the listening address, the `accept()` returns an fs that represents the connection socket. Here is the pseudo-code that explains the typical workflow of a server: 

```
fd = socket()
bind(fd, address)
listen(fd)

while True:
    conn_fd = accept(fs)
    do_something_with(conn_fs)
    close(conn_fd)
```

The `read()` syscall receives data from a TCP connection. The `write()` syscall sends data. The `close()` syscall destroy the resouce referred by the fd and recycles the fd number. 

We have introduced the syscalls needed for server-side network programming. For the client side, the `connect()` syscall takes a socket fd and address and makes a TCP conncetion to that address. Here is the pseudo-code for the client:

```
fs = socket()
connect(fs, address)
do_something_with(fd)
close(fd)

```
