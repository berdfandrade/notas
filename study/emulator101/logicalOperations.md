# Logical Operations 

Before we leave the topic of binary and hex numbers. It's probably a good time to talk about logical operations. You are probalby use to using logic in your code, maybe in a statement like `if ((conditionA) and (conditionB))`. With programs that deal with hardware, you often have to manipulate individual bits in numbers

### AND operation 

Here are all possible results of and AND operation between two obe-bit numbers.

| x | y | result |
|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 |   0		 
| 0 | 1 |   0
| 1 | 0 |   0
| 1 | 1 |   1

The result of AND is only if both vaues are one.
