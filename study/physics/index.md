# Build a simple 2D physics engine for JavaScript games

### Introduction 

2D games come in many different shapes and sizes. In some cases, building your own 2D physics engine, which provides an approximate simulation of systems such as collision detection, is a good choice â€” especially when using JavaScript. Developing a robust physics engine for any platform is difficult, but often a simpler, concise engine is more suitable. If you're in need of a slimmed-down version of a popular physics engine, building one from scratch, without all the bells and whistles, can get the job done efficiently.

In this article, explore one implementation of a physics engine to build the basic framework of a platforming game. Use existing physics engines, such as Box2D, to compare with the example implementation. Code snippets show how the components interact. You can also download the source code for the examples used in this tutorial.
