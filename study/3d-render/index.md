# Build your own 3D renderer

These is the course guide for a workshop I'm holding at Bradfield School of Computer Science. In the two-day workshop, I go through the fundamentals of 3D graphics, with an emphasis on foundational knowledge and hands-on experimentation. The workshop also lets me answer questions in person and help move students along the coursework in a timely fashion, but even without my presence, the material should be useful to a wider audience.

The workshop is laid out a series of lessons, each with a corresponding project. Students learn one foundational concept in each lesson, then implement that concept in their very own 3D renderer.
